xd is unfinished but does compile and run.
sorter is implemeneted using shared memory. Due to the lack of an ascii conversion in c/c++ from integers there is extra data in
the output file that is generated. 
sorter requires two execution arguments, the first being the input file and the second the output file. 
Family obliations kept from further development on unfinished work.
