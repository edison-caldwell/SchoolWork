The program treestat was built around the system call nftw(), which uses calls to stat()/lstat() to recursivly walk through all
directories and their children. The base case for each recursive call is when no subdirectories exist. As the program discovers new files, 
the type of file is recorded and a total count is kept. Any directory used as an argument must be preceeded by '/' else the process will terminate.
If no argument is given when the program is executed then the current working directory will be used.
