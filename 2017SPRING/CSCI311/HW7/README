The program searcher is intended to be used to recover a lost password given the one-way encrypted password and SALT value be provided. 
The command line arguments required to run the program include -N followed by and integer value (diminishing returns for integers larger than 8).
This integer argument will determine the number of threads to create to attempt to recover the password in parralel. If the password is found by a process
it is writen to a file named password. This file will also include the time elapsed to find the password. The program searcher is just a waiting process that creates
worker processes for it. The actual recovery of the password is handled by a program called cracker. Through the execv system call these worker threads are created
and attempt to acomplish the task in parralel. To alter the password to be recovered one only needs to alter the global variables within cracker.cpp (the encrypted password as
well as the cooresponding salt value).
